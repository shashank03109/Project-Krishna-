        <p><b>Great Pyramid of Giza</b>, ancient Egyptian pyramid that is the largest of the three Pyramids of Giza,
            located on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the <u>Nile River in northern Egypt</u>. <b class="black">It
                was built by Khufu (Cheops), the second king of Egypt’s 4th dynasty (c. 2543–c. 2436 bce)</b>, and was
            completed in the early 25th century bce. The Pyramids of Giza are often collectively considered one of the
            Seven Wonders of the World, and they are the last of the wonders still standing.</p>

        <h2>1. More About It :</h2>

            <p>The Great Pyramid is one of the largest buildings ever constructed. <b>It originally stood about 482 feet
                    (147 meters) tall</b>, but erosion and the removal of most of the polished limestone casing
                stones—which made the 0structure smooth and caused it to gleam in the sunlight—have lowered the
                <b>pyramid’s height to 449 feet (137 meters).</b> The base and three sides each measure 755 feet (230
                meters) in length. <u>The pyramid’s sides rise at an angle of <b class="black">51.87°</b></u> and are
                accurately oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass. <b class="black">The Great Pyramid’s
                    core is made of yellowish limestone blocks, and the inner passages are of finer light-colored
                    limestone.</b> The interior burial chamber is built of huge blocks of granite. Approximately <i>2.3
                    million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5.75-million-ton
                    structure,</i> which is a masterpiece of technical skill and engineering ability. The internal
                walls, as well as those few outer-casing stones that still remain in place, show finer joints than any
                other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.</p>

                <h2>2.How It Was Constructed ?</h2>
                <br>
                    <p><b class="black">Questions persist over how the pyramid was built</b>. The most plausible theory
                        is that the <u>Egyptians employed a sloping and encircling embankment of brick, earth, and sand,
                            which was increased in height and in length as the pyramid rose</u> stone blocks were hauled
                        up the ramp by means of sledges, rollers, and levers. According to the ancient <i>Greek
                            historian Herodotus, the Great Pyramid took 20 years to construct and required the labor of
                            100,000 men.</i> This figure is believable given the assumption that these men, who were
                        agricultural laborers, worked on the pyramid only (or primarily) while there was little work to
                        be done in the fields—i.e., <i>when the Nile River was in flood. By the late 20th century,</i>
                        however, archaeologists found evidence that a more limited workforce may have occupied the site
                        on a permanent rather than a seasonal basis. It was suggested that as few as <b>20,000
                            workers</b>, with accompanying support personnel (bakers, physicians, priests, etc.), would
                        have been adequate for the task.</p>
