    <p><b class="black">Petra</b>, <b>ancient city</b>, center of an <b class="black">Arab kingdom</b> in Hellenistic and Roman times, the ruins of which are in southwest <b>Jordan</b>. The city was built on a <u>terrace</u>, pierced from east to west by the <u>Wadi Mūsā</u> (the Valley of Moses)—one of the places where, according to tradition, the Israelite leader <u>Moses</u> struck a rock and water gushed forth. The valley is enclosed by <i>sandstone cliffs</i> veined with shades of red and purple varying to pale yellow, and for this reason Petra was called by the 19th-century English biblical scholar John William Burgon a <i>“rose-red city half as old as Time.</i>” The modern town of Wadi Mūsā, situated adjacent to the ancient city, chiefly serves the steady stream of <b class= black>tourists</b> who continue to visit the site.</p>

    <h2> 1. More About It</h2>
    
    <p>The Greek name <u>Petra</u> (“<i>Rock</i>”) probably replaced the biblical name <u>Sela</u>. Remains from the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods have been discovered at Petra, and <u>Edomites</u> are known to have occupied the area about 1200 bce. Centuries later the <b class=black>Nabataean</b>, an <u>Arab tribe</u>, occupied it and made it the capital of their kingdom. In 312 bce the region was attacked by <i>Seleucid</i> forces, who failed to seize the city. Under Nabataean rule, Petra prospered as a centre of the <u>spice trade</u> that involved such disparate realms as China, Egypt, Greece, and India, and the city’s population swelled to between 10,000 and 30,000.</p>

    <p>When the <u>Nabataean</u>s were defeated by the <u>Romans</u> in 106 ce, Petra became part of the <b class=black>Roman province</b> of Arabia but continued to flourish until changing trade routes caused its gradual commercial decline. After an <i>earthquake</i> (not the first) damaged the city in 551, significant habitation seems to have ceased. The <u>Islamic invasion</u> occurred in the 7th century, and a <b class=black>Crusader</b> outpost is evidence of activity there in the 12th century. After the Crusades, the city was unknown to the Western world until it was rediscovered by the Swiss traveler <u>Johann Ludwig Burckhardt</u> in 1812.</p>

        <h2>2.How It Was Constructed ? </h2>

    <p>Petra was a city built into the natural landscape of southwest <u>Jordan</u> by the <u>Nabataean</u>s, an Arab tribe known for their skill in architecture and engineering. The city’s most impressive feature is its <b class=black>rock-cut architecture</b>, with buildings, tombs, and monuments carved directly into the cliffs of red sandstone. The Nabataeans designed an advanced <i>water management</i> system, including dams, cisterns, and channels, to capture and store water, making the city sustainable in a desert environment. The city was divided into several districts, with public spaces, temples, and residential areas connected by a network of winding paths.
</p>
    <p>
        One of Petra’s most iconic elements is the <u>Siq</u>, a narrow gorge that serves as the main entrance. Buildings like the <b class=black>Treasury</b> (Al-Khazneh) and the Monastery (Ad Deir) are carved into the cliffs and feature a blend of <u>Hellenistic</u> and local architectural styles. Petra thrived as a center of trade, connecting important routes between the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and the Mediterranean.
 
        </p>
        <p>
            Petra’s construction also involved building <u>road networks</u> and <i>aqueducts</i> that connected distant regions and provided water throughout the city. These innovations enabled the thriving urban center to flourish in the desert, supporting <u>trade</u>, <b class=black>agriculture</b>, and <i>cultural exchange</i> between various civilizations, contributing to <b class=black>economic prosperity</b> and <u>socio-political stability</u>..

<h2> 3. What Does This Statue Symbolise ? </h2>

<p> <b class="black">Petra symbolizes the <u>ingenuity</u> of the Nabataeans, blending <u>architecture</u> with nature. It represents cultural prosperity, ancient trade routes, and the rise and fall of civilizations, standing as a historical <b class=black>testament</b>.<p>
