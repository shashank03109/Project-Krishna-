    <p><b class="black">Christ the Redeemer</b>, colossal statue of Jesus Christ at the summit of <u>Mount Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil</u>. Celebrated in traditional and popular songs, <i>Corcovado towers</i> over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s principal port city. The statue of Christ the Redeemer was completed in <b>1931</b> and <u>stands 98 feet (30 metres) tall</u>, its horizontally outstretched<u> arms spanning 92 feet (28 metres)</u>. The statue has become emblematic of both the city of Rio de Janeiro and the whole nation of Brazil.</p>

    <h2> 1. More About It</h2>
    
    <p>The statue, made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of triangular <b class="black">soapstone tiles</b>, sits on a square stone pedestal base about<u> 26 feet (8 metres) high</u>, which itself is situated on a deck atop the mountain’s summit. The statue is the largest Art Deco-style sculpture in the world.</p>

    <p>In the 1850s the <u>Vincentian</u> priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to honour Isabel, princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor <b class="black">Pedro II</b>, although the project was never approved. <i>In 1921 the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 2,310-foot (704-metre)</i> summit, which, because of its commanding height, would make it visible from anywhere in Rio. Citizens <b>petitioned Pres. Epitácio Pessoa</b> to allow the construction of the statue on Mount Corcovado.</p>

        <h2>2.How It Was Constructed ? </h2>
    <p>Permission was granted, and the foundation stone of the base was ceremonially laid on April 4, 1922—to<u>commemorate</u> the centennial on that day of Brazil’s independence from Portugal—although the monument’s final design had not yet been chosen. That same year a competition was held to find a designer, and the <b class="black">Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa</b> was chosen on the basis of his sketches of a figure of <i>Christ holding a cross in his right hand and the world in his left</i>. In collaboration with Brazilian artist <u>Carlos Oswald, Silva Costa</u> later amended the plan; Oswald has been credited with the idea for the figure’s standing pose with arms spread wide. The <u>French sculptor Paul Landowski</u>, who collaborated with Silva Costa on the final design, has been credited as the primary designer of the figure’s head and hands. Funds were raised privately, principally by the church. Under Silva Costa’s supervision, <u>construction began in 1926</u> and continued for five years. During that time materials and workers were transported to the summit via railway.
 
    <p>
        After its completion, the statue was <i>dedicated on October 12, 1931</i>. Over the years it has undergone periodic repairs and renovations, including a thorough cleaning in 1980, in preparation for the visit of<u> Pope John Paul II</u> to Brazil that year, and a major project in 2010, when the surface was repaired and refurbished. Escalators and panoramic elevators were added beginning in 2002; previously, in order to reach the statue itself, tourists climbed more than 200 steps as the last stage of the trip. In 2006, to mark the statue’s <u>75th anniversary</u>, a chapel at its base was consecrated to Our <b>Lady of Aparecida</b>, the patron saint of Brazil.

<h2> 3. What Does This Statue Symbolise ? </h2>

<p> <b class="black">Christ the Redeemer statue is the largest Art Deco design ever built in the history of the world. The statue portrays Jesus with arms open, symbolizing welcome and peace. Its construction was proposed in 1850 by priest Pedro Mario in honor of Emperor Pedro II's daughter, Princess Isabel.<p>
