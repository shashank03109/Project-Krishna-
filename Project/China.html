        <p><b>Great Wall of China</b>, extensive bulwark erected in ancient China, one of the largest building-construction projects ever undertaken. <u>The Great Wall actually consists of numerous walls—many of them parallel to each other—built over some two millennia across northern China and southern Mongolia.</u> The most extensive and best-preserved version of the<b class="black"> wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province.</b> This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and mountains as <i>it snakes across the Chinese countryside, and about one-fourth of its length consists solely of natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges. </i>Nearly all of the rest <b>(about 70 percent of the total length) is actual constructed wall</b>, with the small remaining stretches constituting ditches or moats. Although lengthy sections of the wall are now in ruins or have disappeared completely, it is still one of the more remarkable structures on Earth.<u> The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.</u>

        <p>Large parts of the fortification system date from the <b>7th through the 4th century bce.</b> In the <u>3rd century bce Shihuangdi (Qin Shihuang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system.</u> Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be </i>Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in eastern Hebei province along the coast of the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli),</i> and the wall’s length—without its branches and other secondary sections—was thought to extend for some <b class="black">4,160 miles (6,700 km).</b> However, government-sponsored investigations that began in the 1990s revealed sections of wall in Liaoning, and aerial and satellite surveillance eventually proved that this wall stretched continuously through much of the province. <b>The greater total length of the Ming wall was announced in 2009.</b></p>

        <h2>How It Was Constructed ?</h2>
        
        <p>The Great Wall developed from the disparate border fortifications and castles of individual Chinese kingdoms. For several centuries these kingdoms probably were as concerned with protection from their near neighbours as they were with the threat of barbarian invasions or raids.</p>
        
        <p>About the <i>7th century bce the state of Chu started to construct a permanent defensive system</i>. Known as the <b>“Square Wall,”</b> this fortification was situated in the northern part of the kingdom’s capital province. <u>From the 6th to the 4th century other states followed Chu’s example</u>. In the southern part of the Qi state an extensive perimeter wall was gradually created using existing river dikes, newly constructed bulwarks, and areas of impassable mountain terrain. The Qi wall was made mainly of earth and stone and terminated at the shores of the Yellow Sea.<b class="black"> In the Zhongshan state a wall system was built to thwart invasion from the states of Zhao and Qin in the southwest.</b>There were two defensive lines in the Wei state: <b>the Hexi (“West of the [Yellow] River”) and Henan (“South of the River”) walls. </b>The Hexi Wall was a fortification against the Qin state and western nomads. Built during the reign of <b>King Hui (370–335 bce)</b>, it was expanded from the dikes on the Luo River on the western border.<i> It started in the south near Xiangyuan Cave, east of Mount Hua, and ended at Guyang in what is now the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. </i>Henan Wall, built to <b class="black">protect Daliang (the capital, now Kaifeng)</b>, was repaired and extended in King Hui’s later years. The Zheng state also built a wall system, which was rebuilt by the Han state after it conquered Zheng. <u>The state of Zhao completed a southern wall and a northern wall;</u> the southern wall was built mainly as a defense against the Wei state.</p>
        
        <p>After administrative reorganization was carried out by <b>Shang Yang (died 338 bce),</b> <u>the Qin state grew politically and militarily to become the strongest among the seven states, </u>but it was frequently raided by the Donghu and Loufan, two nomadic peoples from the north. Therefore,<i> the Qin erected a wall that started from Lintiao,</i> went north along the <b>Liupan Mountains</b>, and ended at the <b>Huang He (Yellow River)</b class="black">.</p>
