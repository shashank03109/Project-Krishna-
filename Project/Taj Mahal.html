        <p><b>Taj Mahal</b>, white marble <u>mausoleum</u> complex in <u>Agra</u>, western <u>Uttar Pradesh</u> state, northern <b class="black">India</b>. The Taj Mahal was built by the <u>Mughal emperor </u> <b> Shah Jahan</b> (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his empress consort <u>Mumtaz Mahal</u> (“Beloved Ornament of the Palace”), <i>who died in childbirth in 1631</i>, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. One of India’s most <u>iconic</u> mausoleums, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) <u>bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort)</u>, also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile <b class="black">(1.6 km)</b> west of the Taj Mahal.</p>

        <h2>2. How It Was Constructed ?</h2>
        <br>
        

        <p>The <b class="black">Taj Mahal</b>, inspired by a verse from <u>Bibadal Khan</u>, was built as a replica of <i>Mumtaz Mahal’s celestial home</i>. Construction started in 1632 under chief architect <i>Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī</i> and took <u>22 years</u> to complete, employing over <u>20,000 workers</u> from across India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe. The complex features five key elements: the <b class="black">mausoleum</b>, <b class="black">mosque</b>, <b class="black">jawāb</b>, <b class="black">main gateway</b>, and <b class="black">garden</b>, all designed as an integrated whole. The <b class="black"> mausoleum</b>, made of <i>white marble</i>, is known for its stunning <i>central dome</i> that rises to <u>240 feet</u>, with four smaller domes and <b>minarets</b> surrounding it. Inside, the <b class="black">cenotaphs</b> of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan are surrounded by intricate carvings and <i>pietra dura</i>, while their true tombs lie beneath. The <b class="black">mosque</b> and <b>jawāb</b> are built with <i>red sandstone</i>, creating a contrast to the white marble of the mausoleum. The <b>garden</b>, with watercourses, fountains, and <i>ornamental trees</i>, follows the classical <u>Mughal style</u> and provides a striking reflection of the mausoleum in its central pools. Additionally, the Taj Mahal is noted for its remarkable <i>acoustics</i>, where a single note from a flute reverberates five times inside the central dome.</p>

       
        <p>Two notable decorative features are repeated throughout the complex: <u>pietra dura</u> and <u>Arabic calligraphy</u>. As embodied in the <u>Mughal craft</u>, pietra dura (Italian: “hard stone”) incorporates the inlay of <b >semiprecious stones</b> of various colors, including <i>lapis lazuli, jade, crystal, turquoise, and amethyst,</i> in highly formalized and intertwining geometric and floral designs. The colors serve to moderate the dazzling expanse of the white <u>Makrana marble</u>. Under the direction of <b class="black">Amanat Khan al-Shirazi</b>, verses from the Qurʾān were inscribed across numerous sections of the Taj Mahal in <u>calligraphy</u>, central to <u>Islamic artistic tradition</u>. One of the inscriptions in the <i>sandstone gateway is known as Daybreak (89:28–30)</i> and invites the faithful to enter paradise. </p>
